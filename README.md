For fun repo. Probably will aim to solve 1-2 problems a day maybe?

In each problem I will consider the time complexity of my solution, as well as the complexity of other solutions

Originally this was just gonna be for python, but ill solve it in whatever language i feel like learning at the time

currently using python, go
